# MD5 hashing tool
This is a hashing tool designed to be run as a script. It uses the MD5 algorithm,
which generates a mesage digest of 128 bits or 16 bytes or 32 hex digits. This
program consumes bytes (by default) or UTF-8 strings (if specified).

Usage:

    python .\md5.py [--txt] .\path\to\filename
